===================

Web app that uses ajax request and filtering to display live line graphs and pie charts.

It was created by Justin Parker. While it might not be directly useful, it is hoped that it can be learned from and some techniques can be applied to your project. Some interesting innovations were creating the bootstrap button set from information in the database and setting a default, interacting with the underlying object for the jqPlot charts so they could be modified on the fly.

Libraries:
Twitter Bootstrap v2 (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
jQuery (http://jquery.com)
jqPlot (http://jqplot.com)
Explorer Canvas (http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/)
